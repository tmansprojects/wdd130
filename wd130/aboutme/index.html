    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img alt="Image of me?" src="images/me.jpg">
    <p>I am a graduated student or "non-matriculating taking classes in subjects that interest me. One of those subjects is web development. I already do and have years of experience doing front-end web-dev but have never built anything top to bottom using code. That is why I am in this course! I am married and have a cat and a dog, with a baby on the way. I live in Idaho, and currently work as a radio engineer. I love being Idaho because we get to be so close to many of the things I love in nature such as snowboarding, hiking, rock climbing and boating. I cannot wait to further develop my skills in this class</p>
